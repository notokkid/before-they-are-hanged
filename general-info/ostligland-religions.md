## Religions of Ostligland

## Church of Asmodeus

Asmodeus is the most powerful of the nine archdevils that inhabit Hell, and the only one of Hell's rulers to claim full divinity. He is credited with the penning the contract of creation, within which his followers believe is hidden the means for their patron's eventual rise to supremacy.

- Worshipers

The Church of Asmodeus preaches strict discipline and unwavering devotion from its worshipers; the strong should rule the weak. The Prince of Darkness expects flattery from his followers, appreciating it for what it is, and delights in deals and contracts that secretly favor one party over another. Followers of the Prince of Darkness often include nobles and bureaucrats, especially those participating in the slave trade and in Strix where his worship is openly accepted.

Knights of Asmodeus wear the typical black and red associated with the Dark Prince, often wielding a spiked mace. They seek out order to gain power. Some call themselves paladins to give their behavior a gloss of righteousness.

Beyond humans and other "civilized" races, Asmodeus is commonly worshiped by kobolds. His dogma of subjugation of the weak through trickery appeals to kobolds, who live in a society with a strict hierarchy and use deception to make up for their physical weakness. Asmodeus is also a god of fire, which kobolds use extensively in mining and metalworking. Kobold priests of Asmodeus appeal to their kindred's insecurity and lust for power, making them easily manipulated pawns.

- Clergy

Asmodeus' priests usually dress in clean and orderly red-accented black dress, and often wear horned masks or helmets for ceremonies. Clothing worn is usually expensive, and clearly so, as the faith preaches that wealth attracts wealth. The Church of Asmodeus is oficially banned and abhorred in the Astorian Empire. It is also common for individual priests to offer the sacrifice of a small animal before preparing spells. Clerics of Asmodeus may prepare lesser geas and a variant of geas, and the Church often grants access to infernal healing and greater infernal healing.

The ranks of the Asmodean hierarchy are detailed and heavily tiered, much like the nobility of Strix and the rulership of Hell itself. High ranks include cardinal and demicardinal, and other ranks include high priest. Other ranks have largely not been specified.

- Temples and shrines

Public temples dedicated to Asmodeus contain many diabolical motifs, and can be found throughout Strix and its dependencies, often existing alongside and within the nation's government buildings. In other places he is worshiped in secret houses that exist throughout Lumen. Many of his temples were originally dedicated to other gods, and later acquired by his faithful to serve their profane purposes. While in the churches of other deities Asmodeus is most often depicted as an adversary or foil, the Church of Asmodeus always shows him in a position of dominance.

## The One True God

The One True God is the God of righteous valor, justice, and honor, associated with Healing and the Sun.
God teaches temperance and patience in all things. Compassion and peace are the greatest virtues, and if enemies of the faith can be redeemed, they should be. Yet there are those who have no interest in redemption, who glory in slaughter and death. From the remorseless evil of the undead and fiends to the cruelties born in the hearts of mortals, God's doctrines preach swift justice delivered by the scimitar's edge. To this end, God expects faithful to be skilled at swordplay, both as a form of martial art promoting centering of mind and body, and so that when they do enter battle, their foes do not suffer any longer than necessary.

- Worshipers

The One True God's priests are composed of clerics and paladins. Personal cleanliness as well as an honorable demeanor are both very important for her followers. An hour of prayer a day is practiced, in addition to a weekly public worship service. 

- Clergy

The paladins of The One True God are just and strong, crusaders who live for the joy of righteous battle. Their mission is to right wrongs and eliminate evil at its root. They serve as examples to others, and their code demands they protect the weak and innocent by eliminating sources of oppression, rather than merely the symptoms. They may back down or withdraw from a fight if they are over-matched, but if their lives will buy time for others to escape, they must give them.

- Temples and shrines

The temples of The One True God function as both a church and living space for her holy knights. Also commonly used are former temples of Aroden. These buildings are often painted white and feature arched entrances, pillared courtyards, fountains, and statues.

- Holy texts

The one book common to all churches of The One True God is The Birth of Light and Truth, is the principal holy book of the religion. A major part of the book is historical, dating from the creation of the Universe, but also contains practical texts explaining the beliefs of the church, offering advice on dealing with sin and temptation, and many parables of evil creatures seeing the light of Divinity and turning to good, productive lives thereafter.

## The Stranger

The Stranger is death. He levels all differences. Named Men and nobodies, south or north. He catches everyone in the end, and treats each man the same. The origin of The Stranger is uncertain, but has generally been seen as meaning "the unseen one" since antiquity. The Stranger is not depicted in any shape or form, because Death can come at any time, and it can come in any form.

- Worshipers

The Stranger is predominantly worshipped (and feared) in the Alavus Protectorate by the Northmen. Barbarians and warriors who make their glory in battle.

- Clergy

The Stranger has no official clergy. There are no standardized rituals, but the Northmen do believe that The Stranger has a keen eye for a good bloodshed.

- Temples and shrines

There are no temples of worship of The Stranger. The Northmen believe that The God of Death is best worshipped in the field of battle, or in a duel to the death. Some barbarian cairns are often considered holy, sacred grounds that demand respect and sacrfice. It is not unheard of that many duels are fought in places such as this, usually the cairn of some ancestor of one of the duelists in question, as it is customary in the North for family to rest together. 

- Holy texts

The People who believe and worship The Stranger do not have any scriptures or holy books. Instead, they rely on folk wisdom and tales to carry on the belief of their God of Death. Many of these tales are often anecdotes told by Named Men over the course of time, their interpretation of a famous battle where The Stranger loomed over, counting his prizes. Others might come from the Bards and Skalds, who will often spin wondrous tales of heroic adventures. 

## Loa of Koriesh

The Loa of Koriesh are a peculiar religion. While not technically deities themselves, the Loa act as an intermediary between the people, and the Unconscious All, that is the Universe. Humans can neither perceive nor understand the vastness of the cosmos as it is, so the Loa have sprung into existence.

- Worshipers

The Loa represent all aspects of life, so many of their worshippers are rangers or druids, even though some sorcerers also find them fitting as well. These worshippers believe that life is the ultimate cosmological constant, the greatest achievement of the Unconscious All. Even if a life is to be taken, it has to be discussed with the Loa, for they know both Life and Death as well.

- Clergy

Clerics attuned towards nature and druids are rugged folk and many are hermits. Men are expected to have long beards and women long hair. Seaweed, natural items, and strands of white cloth are often braided into the hair of the faithful. Formal raiment is usually long robes of sea-green, storm-grey, or sky blue color, decorated with coral or pearls. 
The members are active in their respective communities, leading by example and serving in various capacities as needed by those that live around them.

- Temples and shrines

Loa Shrines are always open to the sky and often contain some sort of pool or open water at the heart. They often appear in out-of-the-way places and are typically built using only slightly worked local materials, such as driftwood and unquarried stone. Services and occasions vary from shrine to shrine, though most ceremonies involve offerings, prayers, and chanting. Some temples venerate either his male or female forms and portfolio, while Temples in port cities most often worship both at once.

- Holy texts

The Worshippers of the Loa write their texts solely on stone and does not use paper. These texts are complicated and one usually needs to read on multiple stones to understand a single document, which helps protecting the faith's secrets from infidels. For the same reason, they have a strong oral tradition, and initiates of the faith need to be able to remember large amounts of information. High-ranking members sometimes compile their thoughts on the Faith's teachings into songs or speeches.
