# Astorian Empire

For more than a thousand years, Castleton has been the City at the Center of the World. A massive metropolis, and the crown jewel of the Astorian Empire. The first High King and founder of The Empire was Albinus the Great, many years ago. Albinus was the ruler of one of Midlands many petty kingdoms, often at war with one another. In time, the Empire expanded and matured to what it is today. 

- Geography

Situated at the center of the great continent of Ostligland, Astoria is the largest empire in the world. The ice-capped peaks of the Escadar Mountains are among the highest known in the world, stretching high above the treeline. 


- Economy

Astoria's great wealth is driven both by trade and produce. The city rulers strive to craft policies favorable to commerce, and their own interests, but even they cannot ignore the engulfing grasp of bureaucracy for long.
There are no property taxes, although acces to roads, sanitation and other public infrastructure is charged. These, alongside modest taxes and customs tarifs on foreign merchants, docking fees are generally sufficient to supply the needs of the Empire.

- Government

Astoria is ruled by three executive powers. The High King, as well as the Closed Council, and the House of Nobles. Although the High King technically possesses vast powers, in reality the Astorian Empire is governed mostly by the Closed Council with only brief interactions with the King himself. The Closed council is composed of several select members. A Lord of Law, A Lords of War, A Lord of Money and A Lords of the King's Household.
The vast powers of the King and the Closed Council are held in check by the House of Nobles, a regular assembly of the realm's noblemen.

# Alavus Protectorate

The Alavus Protectorate is the northern most region of Ostligland. The Northmen who live there are a clan-based warrior society.
Grima Jomsborg was a legendary hero and great war-leader in Alavus. He united the Northmen clans, seemingly through diplomacy (blackmail, duress, deceit), in order to prevent The Astorian Empire from extending its influence into The North. Grima's Chair is now considered the throne of the King in the North. In more recent years, Alavus has become much divided as multiple Jarls struggle for the throne.

- Geography

The region is heavily forested with pine-covered hills, and snow-capped mountains, in particular the chain of mountains called the High Places. Trondheim itself is perfectly situated at the merging spot of several rivers providing easy transport.

- Economy

The economy of Alavus is entirely dependent on the Astorian Empire. Most people live off the land, relying on small farms and such to bring food to the table. Those that cannot grow or trade settle for stealing and looting.

- Government

Alavus is ruled by the King in the North and his Jarls, functioning mostly as his trusted advisors.
For the past 30 years, Alavus has been a protectorate of the Empire, after the latter's rather botched attempt at conquest. It is not surprising that Alavus has chosen to come under the banner of King Graur of Ostenso.

Outsiders often consider the Northmen barbarians and savages, particularly in The Empire. They speak a Northern version of the Common Language, barely comprehensible to those who speak Common. The Northmen are a clan-based warrior society, with a history of inter-clan warfare, heavy with bloody feuds, and vengeances.

A big part of society in Alavus are so called Named Men. Those warriors who have earned great respect in battle. Most earn names such as Bj√∏rn Ironhead (Got his name for his famous deadly headbutts), Bonebreaker Gorm (Known for his large Warhammer), Halfur the Impaler (self explanatory) and so on.

# Strix

Infernal Strix remains one of the most powerful nations militarily in Ostligland. Nevertheless, as important as the nation may be today, it pales in comparison to its former Imperial glories. Today, in the eyes of most external observers in other parts of Ostligland, Strix suffers from extreme diabolism and a tyranny which prevent it from truly achieving its full potential. Internal observers, including the new nobility of Strix, firmly believe that Asmodeus and Hell serve Strix and assist in maintaining the power necessary for Strix to assume its rightful role among the leading nations of Ostligland.

- Geography
Strix covers a piece of the Northern parts of Ostligland. Divided into six regions or archduchies ruled over by Noble Houses, the power of Strix is split between Hellcoast, Ravounel, Menador, The Heartlands, Sirmium and Longmarch.
Nearly 30% of Strix is mountanous, with several valleys settled between the jagged mountains. Many elements of the Strix territory are of volcanic origin. Summers are warm and humid, and its winters are chilly, rainy and foggy.

- Economy

A lot of the wealth owned by Strix comes from its own natural resources. The mountains are full of precious metals and the plains and valleys are more than capable of sustaining the food necessities of the people of Strix. On top of all this, Strix has also traded with the people of the Vastligland continent, being a strong player in the slave trade market. 

- Government 

His Majesty King Harod rules as absolute monarch in his nation. His word carries the full weight of law, and is as inescapable as any devil's contract.
The rest of the power in Strix rests in the mighty graps of its noble houses that have existed for centuries. Most of the oldest houses survived the civil war that ravaged the country a century ago, although those who aligned themselves with the diabolists early in the war have claimed the greatest prestige and wealth. 
Strix nobility are arranged in a strict hierarchy of three broad categories (dukes, counts, and barons), each with their own subcategories, for a sum of nine ranks modeled after the nine levels of Hell; the King and his family are above this order.
The King maintains control of the nation's complex bureaucracy of titled nobles through fear and the hope of earning the King's favor.
