# Astorian Empire
For more than a thousand years, Castleton has been the City at the Center of the World. A massive metropolis, and the crown jewel of the Astorian Empire.

- Geography
Situated at the center of the great continent of Ostligland, Astoria is the largest empire in the world. The ice-capped peaks of the Escadar Mountains are among the highest known in the world, stretching high above the treeline. 


- Economy
Astoria's great wealth is driven both by trade and produce. The city rulers strive to craft policies favorable to commerce, and their own interests, but even they cannot ignore the engulfing grasp of bureaucracy for long.
There are no property taxes, although acces to roads, sanitation and other public infrastructure is charged. These, alongside modest taxes and customs tarifs on foreign merchants, docking fees are generally sufficient to supply the needs of the Empire.

- Government
Astoria is ruled by three executive powers. The High King, as well as the open and the closed council. Although the High King technically possesses vast powers, in reality the Astorian Empire is governed mostly by the Closed Council with only brief interactions with the King himself. The Closed council is composed of twelve select members. Three Lords of Law, three Lords of War, three Lords of Money and three Lords of the King's Household.
The vast powers of the King and the Closed Council are held in check by the Open Council, a regular assembly of the realm's noblemen.
